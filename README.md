# OSGi Kt

## What

This project aims to deliver a Kotlin wrapper around the standard OSGi API bundles. These wrapper bundles should add
minimal overhead and enrich the OSGi API with Kotlin friendly extensions.

## Why

Kotlin is 100% compatible with plain-old Java. Therefore Kotlin can be used in an OSGi environment. To make full use of
Kotlin idoms in OSGi some small extension are needed.

## How

This project contains wrapper bundles for the Core API and the Compendium. The bundles are generated using Gradle and BND.
The resulting bundles will be uploaded to maven central.
