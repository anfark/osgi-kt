# OSGi.kt

## What

The goal of OSGi.kt is to provide Kotlin extension bundles for the standard OSGi API. These new bundles should introduce
minimal overhead and enrich the OSGi world with Kotlin friendly extensions.

## Why

Kotlin is 100% compatible with plain-old Java. Therefore, Kotlin can be used in OSGi applications. The extension bundles 
bring the benefits of the awesome features of Kotlin to OSGi.

## How

This project contains extension bundles for the Core API and the OSGi Compendium. The bundles are generated using Gradle 
and BND. The resulting artifacts will be uploaded to an Maven repository after they reach a stable state.
